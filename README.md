# Vaulter

Tired of remembering login details for every website you register at? Are you one of those who deliberatly wants to keep a separate password for every website you register, anxious that one hack might give away all my data? Are you also an OCD about not saving all your login details in a third party app?

Look no further, Vaulter is a safe, self owned data repo where you can save all your logins and retrieve it right when you need it. Vaulter is a chrome extension is linked to and reads from a google-sheet (_for now_) where you can save your login details and retrieve it right when you are on a website's login page.
